When first examining the budget data that was provided, I calcuated the sum of the profit/losses values which turned out to be 22,564,198. It was also found that the total time period covered by data was 86 months. I then calculated the monthly changes in profits over the entire time period. 
Upon analyzing the changes, I discovered that the greatest decrease in profits was in February 2014, with a decrease of -1,825,558. Although in August 2016, the greatest increase in profit was revealed to be 1,862,002.
These findings show that the greatest increase in profits is greater than the greatest decrease. Despite this, the average monthly profit change was -8,311.11, showing that the bank was actually losing more money than it was earning overall.
